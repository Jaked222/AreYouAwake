        This is a very simple app designed to help you lucid dream. All you need to do to use it is start the app and then let it run in the background.
        You can continue to use your phone as normal, or just keep it in your pocket. At some interval (configurable in the settings), a reminder will pop up telling you
        to follow one of the following instructions: \n \n “Hop” means to literally hop. Gravity in dreams usually works differently. \n\n

        “Check a clock” When you see this, look at a clock. Look away, then look at it again. In a dream, clocks never stay at the same time. \n\n

        \"Look at your hand” Your mind can\'t properly create the back of your hand in a dream. It will look very distorted if you\'re in a dream.
        You\'ll know. \n\n

        \"Flick a light switch\" Light switches don’t work in dreams.\n\n

        \"Push through your hand\" Your fingers will go through your hand or sometimes even other objects. Try this. \n\n

        \"Do I know that I am awake?\" Sometimes just asking yourself this question will be enough. Making it a habit to become aware of the world around you and the situation
        you've found yourself in is very useful for mindfulness in and out of dreams. Take a moment to pay attention to what you are feeling and the thoughts that arise here. \n\n \n

        The purpose of doing these things is to set a habit
        of checking whether or not you\'re sleeping. Eventually you\'ll do this in a dream, and it will spark you to become conscious. At this point,
        you\'re lucid.
