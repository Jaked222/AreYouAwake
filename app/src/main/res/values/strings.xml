    <string name="app_name">Lucid Dream</string>
    <string name="lucid">This is a very simple app designed to help you lucid dream. All you need to do to use it is start the app and then let it run in the background.
        You can continue to use your phone as normal, or just keep it in your pocket. At random intervals, a reminder will pop up telling you
        to follow on of the instructions: \n \n “Hop” means to literally hop. Gravity in dreams usually works differently. \n\n
        “Check a clock” When you see this, look at a clock. Look away, then look at it again. In a dream, clocks never stay at the same time. \n\n
        \"Look at you hand” Your mind can\'t properly create the back of your hand in a dream. It will look very distorted if its a dream.
        You\'ll know. \n\n \"Flick a light switch\" Light switches don’t work in dreams.\n\n \n The purpose of doing these things is to set a habit
        of checking whether or not you\'re sleeping. Eventually you\'ll do this in a dream, and it will spark you to become conscious. At this point,
        you\'re lucid.</string>
